ELM-MVClustering
===========================

This work proposes a novel multi-view clustering
framework with ELM to further improve clustering performance, and implements
three algorithms based on this framework. In this framework, the normalized
features of each individual view are mapped onto a higher dimensional
feature space by the ELM random mapping.
